# **App Name**: Cosmic Compass

## Core Features:

- Destination Selection: Users can select a destination such as a planet, star, nebula, exoplanet, or galaxy to begin their FTL journey.
- FTL Drive Animation: An animated timeline visually represents the distance compression as the user "jumps" to their selected destination.
- Exploration Interface: Display facts, imagery, 3D views, recent events, and missions related to the explored destination. The information presented will use a tool to incorporate the best information.
- Route Sharing and Collection: Allow users to collect "starmarks" and journal entries, as well as share their routes with others.
- Search Functionality: Implement a search feature for quickly locating specific celestial bodies (Solar System objects), exoplanets, and Messier/NGC objects.
- Dynamic Data Integration: Display up-to-date APOD images, Hubble/James Webb assets, data on near-Earth objects, and current space weather conditions.
- 3D Map Visualization: Develop a 3D map using WebGL and three.js to create a starfield and enable camera "warp" travel effects.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep space blue (#243A73) to evoke the vastness of space.
- Background color: Dark navy (#121A33), desaturated to 20% to not distract.
- Accent color: Electric purple (#BE52C9) to highlight interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' for a modern, neutral look, suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for displaying code snippets.
- Use clean, minimalist icons to represent different celestial bodies and actions.
- Implement smooth transitions and subtle animations for a seamless user experience when navigating through the cosmos.
